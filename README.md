# dotfiles
Just my config. :)

Currently using Arch Linux (https://www.archlinux.org/).

## Getting Started

### Installing

Run `install`, which will create links for all files in this repo. PLEASE read the script before executing. Also, note that conflicting files will not be linked!

Also, my configuration is very much targeted for the hardware I am currently using. 
You will probably have to adapt this to your needs, or just use it as inspiration.

### Prerequisites

Check `pkglist.txt` for required packages. Note that some of these may require additional manual steps for installation.
