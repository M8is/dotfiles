# dotfiles
Just my config. :)

Currently using Debian 10 (https://www.debian.org/).

## Getting Started

### Installing

Run `install`, which will create links for all files in this repo. A backup will be created in `{REPOSITORY_DIR}_backup` (e.g. `~/.dotfiles_backup`), next to where you checkout this repository.

### Prerequisites
Check `pkglist.txt` for installed packages from the repositories. Note that some programs require manual steps for installation, thus are installed in the `install` script. I strongly recommend reading the script before installing this setup anyway.
